Hello again!

Some updates since last post:

Claude Code is quite fun to use - for simple tasks that I'm not as savvy on, like prototyping a simple webapp or code change in jekyll. We've been making great use of ChatGPT Codex at work to support migration efforts from SQL Server to Databricks jobs. Summarizing a lot of AI hype and industry pundits / LinkedIn supposed thought leaders, it seems like AI assisted coding is here to stay - but large systems architecture knowledge will still be important, and developer jobs are likely safe. We'll just use new tools. 

I've been slowly working my way through 'How to Prove It', a math textbook for an introductory proof course in college. I've always enjoyed mathematics and had a side interest in it for some time - Working through this book is an exercise to shore up my background in formal proofs, since I took more applied courses in college and my masters program. 

We've just started a schedule for ourselves during the week (which especially helps us with balancing taking care of Luke and our remote work jobs), and mornings have become a time for any reading and personal enrichment. Initially I was planning on completing one section of the proof book a day so I could finish it within six weeks - that was about six weeks ago, when I was more ambitious in planning. Cal Newport's Slow Productivity (and an answer he gave to someone on his podcast who was trying to balance multiple hobbies) gave me some needed relaxing advice, which was to be okay with slow production. In many cases it took years for very talented people to make their historic breakthroughs - and seeing Luke make slow progress in building his muscles that he will one day use to crawl, and stand, and walk is inspiring. He'll just struggle and enjoy it, and has no expectation that it will lead anywhere - but it will! 

So here's to a slow, productive, and peaceful accomplishment of our goals in life.
