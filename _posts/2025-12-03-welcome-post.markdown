Hello and Welcome!

This blog is an attempt to create an online space where I am somewhat regular in posting articles. Think of it as akin to a technical journal - I'll be using it as a space to upload short primers and projects that I've been working on. 

The goal is to publish about one of these a month, and that they'll track any personal projects that I've been developing during that time. 

Also - my wife and I are expecting our firstborn this month! Very exciting times ahead for us, we shall see how consistently I'll be able to keep this up!

Blessings and a very Merry Advent and Christmas season ahead to you all!
