Hello again!

We've welcomed Luke the newborn into our home, and all is well - parenthood is just as joyful as it seems on the outside. The little guy is cutely cooing this morning in the home office bassient while I type away here. 

This is the last day of the month, and as a commitment to myself, I'm writing this short post to say that I'm giving Claude Code a whirl. I've been using ChatGPT Codex at work and found it wonderful for quickly skimming over codebases and finding small programming errors or summarizing areas to take a closer look at. It has been extremely helpful at understanding refactored and migrated codebases while we're transitioning away from a contracting team that worked hard on migration efforts for our company. 

For the sake of variety (and because there are many industry and WSJ articles singing Claude's praises) I am trying Claude's Pro subscription out so I have access to Claude Code. It's helping me deploy this new change to the website (although all writing is my own). I'm also looking forward to using it for personal projects and improving my overall understanding of writing good code and designing good architecture. 

Versa L'alto!
